The Dinosaur Game (also known as the Chrome Dino) is a built-in browser game in the Google Chrome web browser. The player guides a pixelated Tyrannosaurus rex across a side-scrolling landscape, avoiding obstacles to achieve a higher score. The game was created by Sebastien Gabriel in 2014, and is intended to be accessed by hitting the space bar when Google Chrome is offline.
